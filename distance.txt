For my calculations, I run the same process 3 different time for the first, second, and total distances. This process is converting all inputs for distance 1 and 2 into inches and finding their sums respectivley. Then I add the two distances to find the sum of the distances. Then to find the miles, yards, feet, and inches of each I would mod the total by 12, because the total was in inches and modding by 12 will give how many inches are left. Then I would divide the total by 12 to move from inches to feet. Then I would mod that by 3 to find the remainder of feet left. Then divide by 3 to move from feet to yards, mod that total by 1760 (1760 yards in a mile) to find the remainding yards. And finally, divide the total by 1760 to find the remaining miles. This process was done for distance 1, 2, and the total of the two distances.
