In the computation section of my code, I first find the thickness of the pipe by subtracing the outer radius by the inner radius. Then I find the volume by multiplying pie by the outer radius squared mines the inner radius squared and then all of that multiplied by the length of the pipe. Then I also found the surface area of the pipe by using the equation pie times the length of the pipe and 2 times the radius of the pipe. I did that for the inner and outer pipe and then found the surface area of the rings on the end of the pipe. This equation 2 times pie times outer radius squared minus pie times the inner radius squared and all of that multiplied by 2. Then I found the total surface area by adding the surface area of the rings and inner and outer pipe.
